we can use lambda expression for a functional interface(where we have only one abstract method)
for example we have an anonymous class.
new Thread(new Runnable(){
    public void run(){System.out.println("Thread Created");}
}).start();

now we can convert in into lambda expression such as

new Thread(
    ()-> {System.out.println("Thread created");}
).start();
